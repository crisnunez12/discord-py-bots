# Python-Bots
Some python bots I made

So basically, 


KidSpammy69 is a bot I made as a joke, just to see if it could properly spam some funny things with my name on it.
Of course, I didn't *actually* make it spam, but I could, assuming I make it send 300 messages instead of 3, once a certain command is run.
This is an easy to make bot.

FaxMusic is an attempt to do a music bot.
It works perfectly fine as long as download = False, issue being, youtube seems to be somehow blocking the media's audio-streaming, which seemingly makes the bot randomly stop playing sound on discord.
Sadly, the only way to fix this is to set download = True, which ruins the taskloop based-off the song duration, given that it takes time for the song to be downloaded (in fact, it usually takes up to 40 seconds, which is too much to wait for, both for the user and the server running the bot.
