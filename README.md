# Python-Bots
Some python bots I made

So basically, 

#---------------------#

FaxMusicBot is a music bot made to be used in one of my servers.
This is intended just as a show, you should NOT COPY this code nor use it, although you could make something similar by looking at it.

This bot has all the basic options:

*- play : plays a song given the youtube url.
*- skip : skips to the next song on the list (or warns you that there is no next on the list!)
*- pause : literally, pauses
*- unpause : you should be able to guess what this does

Plus, many other commands which contain information about its creator (myself), upcoming projects and so on.

Feel free to explore the code and understand it.

*--KNOWN ISSUES--*

*- Sometimes pafy's webmedia scrapping fails miserably, causing it to have keyerrors such as: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72417669/141794022-69f03b27-fd9a-4d93-a9f9-5b4142ee547c.png) - Hopefully I will find a fix to this soon, as it is very annoying, plus if it happens with the first song to be played, it would force the user to skip it in order to go to the next one, or let the bot stay silent for the songs duration.

*- Sometimes it can randomly lag the music, arguably due to network issues/ too many API requests.
